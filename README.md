# BC

**Bc** is an R package for dealing with **genetic barcode** data.

## What you can do with **Bc**

In other words, what Bc can do for you. If you are reading these words, you must
know the general knowledge of genetic barcodes. If you don't, maybe you need
to read the following reviews "# TODO add paper links". Of course, our article about
this tool is also good (but not yet written).

Briefly, **Bc** can provide you (so far)

- Quality control the DNA sequence results and filter the sequences according
  to the quality metrics.

- Parsing sequences, extracting Barcode (and UMI) information.

- Quality control and filter the Barcode. And give you reliable Barcodes.

- Toolkits make it easier to manipulate Barcode data.

If you want to learn more about the **Bc** utilization, reading the examples in
vignettes can be a good way (Vignette link):

- [Barcode with UMI]()
