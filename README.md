# BC

**Bc** is a R package for dealing with **genetic barcode** data.

## What you can do with **Bc**

In other words, what Bc can do for you. If you are an ordinary users, you must
know the general knowledge of genetic barcode. If you don't, maybe you need
read following reviews "# TODO add paper links". Of course, our article about
this tool is also good (but not yet written) :-p.

Briefly, **Bc** can provide you (so far)

- Quality control the DNA sequence results and filter the sequences according
  to the quality metrics.

- Parsing sequences, extracting Barcode (and UMI) information.

- Quality control and filter the Barcode. And give you reliable Barcode.

- Provide Toolkits makes it easier to manipulate Barcode data.

If you want to learn more about the **Bc** utilization, reading the examples in
vignette can be a good way (Vignette link):

- [Barcode with UMI]()

- [More example]()

## Installing

1. Use the `devtools` install package from github

```
library(devtools)
install_github("wenjie1991/Bc")
```

2. Release in GitHub ...

3. Bioconductor
TBD (I hope the package can be accepted in Bioconductor).

## Contributing

**Bc** Package has similarities to life. 

- It has a birthday, which is when it was first released.

- It grows, as the version number increases, and more functions are added.

- It will die ðŸ’€, and one day it will be unusable (or/and useless).

If you think it's useful to you now, then please make the most of it. "Useful"
is the value of its existence.

If you think it's not so good to use, then please:

Pull requests are welcome. If you encounter any trouble, open an issue before
give it up.
