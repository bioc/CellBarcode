Description: 
  This package performs DNA Barcode analysis. The package can handle all kinds
  of DNA barcodes, as long as the barcode withine a single reads and has a
  pattern that can be matched by regular expression. This package can handle
  barcode with flexible length, with or without UMI (unique molecular
  identifier). This tool also can be used for preprocssing of amplicon data
  analysis such as CRISPR gRNA screening, immue repotoire sequencing and meta
  genome data.
