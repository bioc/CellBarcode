Description: 
  This package performs Cellular DNA Barcode (genetic lineage tracing) analysis. The package can handle all kinds of DNA barcodes, as long as the barcode within a single sequencing read and has a pattern which can be matched by a regular expression. This package can handle barcode with flexible length, with or without UMI (unique molecular identifier). This tool also can be used for pre-processing of some amplicon data such as CRISPR gRNA screening, immune repertoire sequencing and meta genome data.
