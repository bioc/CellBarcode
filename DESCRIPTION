Description: 
  This package performs Cellular DNA Barcode (genetic lineage tracing) analysis.
  The package can handle all kinds of DNA barcodes, as long as the barcode
  within a single sequencing read and has a pattern which can be matched by a
  regular expression. This package can handle barcode with flexible length, with
  or without UMI (unique molecular identifier). This tool also can be used for
  pre-processing of some amplicon sequencing such as CRISPR gRNA screening, immune
  repertoire sequencing and meta genome data.
